SentimentAnalysis_GUI

This program classifies tweets based on their sentiment. It uses an existing machine learning library to classify tweets as opposed to counting positive and negative words. The hope is that it will be able to achieve a better classification accuracy using a more advanced tool.
I added simple functionality for maintaining a database of tweets, which can be extended by adding new tweets. A user can later search that database to refer back to specific tweets.
The user will be able to save the database and load it again the next time the program runs.
